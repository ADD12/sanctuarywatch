In this repository, you'll find the Wordpress plugin and theme that create the customized Graphic Data experience within a Wordpress environment. 

## What is Graphic Data?
Graphic Data is an open-source framework for combining artwork with data in a way that is: 1) easy (and attractive!) to use by web users and 2) easy to use by those tasked with entering content. This framework is intended for the small-yet-mighty organizations and people who have big website ambitions, but don't necessarily have big website capacity.

## Is Graphic Data being used anywhere?
Yes! Check out [Sanctuary Watch](https://sanctuarywatch.ioos.us/american-samoa/overview/), a website that shows the information used in the management of sanctuaries within the [National Marine Sanctuary System](https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/).

## How do I learn more about using Sanctuary Watch?

## Earlier Work
The general approach taken by Graphic Data is based upon [Infographiq](https://github.com/marinebon/infographiq), created by [Ben Best](https://ecoquants.com/).
The plugin is based upon the structure provided by Joe Sz's [Wordpress Plugin Boilerplate Tutorial](https://github.com/JoeSz/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate-Tutorial) - which is itself based upon the structure provided by Devin Vinson's [Wordpress Plugin Boilerplate](https://github.com/DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate).
