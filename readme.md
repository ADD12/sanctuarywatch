In this repo, you'll find the Wordpress plugin and theme that create the customized "Webenized Condition Report" experience within a Wordpress environment. 

## Getting Started
The plugin, called webCR, is based upon the structure provided by Joe Sz's [Wordpress Plugin Boilerplate Tutorial](https://github.com/JoeSz/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate-Tutorial) - which is itself based upon the structure provided by Devin Vinson's [Wordpress Plugin Boilerplate](https://github.com/DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate). The purpose of using this template structure is to provide, in the words of Devin, "a standardized, organized, object-oriented foundation for building high-quality WordPress plugins".

How to get started with the code in this repo? The best way is to get a new instance of WordPress running locally on your computer and then import this repo in.

This repo is designed to reside within the wp-content directory of your Wordpress installation ([here's some info on the Wordpress directory structure](https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/beginners-guide-to-wordpress-file-and-directory-structure/), if you're new to it). 

Our recommended solution for WordPress development on your local machine is [Local](https://localwp.com/). For ease of WordPress development, we also recommend using Visual Studio Code, Local, and Xdebug in an integrated way ([and here are instructions on how to do that](https://webdevstudios.com/2022/10/06/debugging-wordpress/)).
