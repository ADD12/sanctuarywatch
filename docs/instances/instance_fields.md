# Instance Fields | Guide

Instances are the second highest level of organization on Graphic Data. Each Instance represents a program or project space and contains Scenes (Scenes operate on .svg files). It is important to note that instances link directly to a single Scene, but can contain many Scenes. The overview scene (a field listed below) is the scene that your site visitors will see after they click a button to access your instance. 

Hierarchy: **Instance Type ‚Üí <span style="color:red;">Instances (We are Here)</span> ‚Üí Scenes ‚Üí Modals ‚Üí Figures**.

Instances cannot be displayed on the visitor side of the site unless they are published.

**When Finished Making Field Selections: <span style="color:red;"> Press "SAVE" in the top right of the page.</span>**
