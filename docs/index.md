Welcome to the documentation for Graphic Data, a WordPress plugin and theme.

## Overview

Graphic Data is an open-source framework for combining artwork with data in a way that is: 1) easy (and attractive!) to use by web users and 2) easy to use by those tasked with entering content. This framework is intended for the small-yet-mighty organizations and people who have big website ambitions, but don't necessarily have big website capacity.

## Quick Start

1. Check our our **[installation]({{ site.baseurl }}/installation)** guide.
