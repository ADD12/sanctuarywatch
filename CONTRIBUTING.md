# Contributing to Sanctuary Watch
Thanks so much for considering contributing to Sanctuary Watch! Here you'll find a series of guidelines to make your contribution process as easy and as awesome as possible! By the way, a tip of the hat to activeadmin, as we grabbed a lot of our contributing guidelines from [them](https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md).

First off, if you haven't seen them already, please do check out our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Readme](readme.md).

## Getting Started
In this repo, you'll find the Wordpress plugin and theme that create the customized "Webenized Condition Report" experience. The plugin, called webCR, is based upon the structure provided by Joe Sz's [Wordpress Plugin Boilerplate Tutorial](https://github.com/JoeSz/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate-Tutorial) - which is itself based upon the structure provided by Devin Vinson's [Wordpress Plugin Boilerplate](https://github.com/DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate). The purpose of using this template structure is to provide, in the words of Devin, "a standardized, organized, object-oriented foundation for building high-quality WordPress plugins".

How to get started with the code in this repo? The best way is to get WordPress running locally on your computer and then import this repo in.
This repo is designed to reside within the wp-content directory of your Wordpress installation ([here's some info on the Wordpress directory structure](https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/beginners-guide-to-wordpress-file-and-directory-structure/), if you're new to it). 

Our recommended solution for WordPress development on your local machine is [Local](https://localwp.com/). For ease of WordPress development, we also recommend using Visual Studio Code, Local, and Xdebug in an integrated way ([and here are instructions on how to do that](https://webdevstudios.com/2022/10/06/debugging-wordpress/)).

## Pull requests
Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.

It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature. To avoid this from happening, we request that contributors contact jai.ranganathan@noaa.gov to first discuss any new ideas. Your ideas and suggestions are welcome!

## Where do I go from here?  
For any questions, support, or ideas, etc. please contact jai.ranganathan@noaa.gov. If you've noticed a bug, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/ioos/sanctuarywatch/issues).
