# Contributing to Sanctuary Watch
Thanks so much for considering contributing to Sanctuary Watch! Here you'll find a series of guidelines to make your contribution process as easy and as awesome as possible! By the way, a tip of the hat to activeadmin, as our contributing guidelines come from [them](https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md).

First off, if you haven't seen them already, please do check out our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Readme](readme.md).

## Pull requests
Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.

It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature. To avoid this from happening, we request that contributors contact jai.ranganathan@noaa.gov to first discuss any new ideas. Your ideas and suggestions are welcome!

## Where do I go from here?  
For any questions, support, or ideas, etc. please contact jai.ranganathan@noaa.gov. If you've noticed a bug, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/ioos/sanctuarywatch/issues).
