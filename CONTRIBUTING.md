## Getting Started
In this repo, you'll find the Wordpress plugin and theme that create the customized "Webenized Condition Report" experience. The plugin, called webCR, is based upon the structure provided by Joe Sz's [Wordpress Plugin Boilerplate Tutorial](https://github.com/JoeSz/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate-Tutorial) - which is itself based upon the structure provided by Devin Vinson's [[Wordpress Plugin Boilerplate](https://github.com/DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate). The purpose of using this template structure is to provide, in the words of Devin, "a standardized, organized, object-oriented foundation for building high-quality WordPress plugins".
